Every channel of deep dream

`python3.6 processing_images.py`
`favorites` is a collection of cool layers.
`processed_channels` are the original `channels` after being processed with `processing_images.py`. They were saturated and sharpened.
`video_images` are the resulting images after running DCGANs on them. Most of the images look like tie-dye.
`videos` are some videos made from some test_images batch.
`edited_code.py` is the code we edited in the DCGANs jupyter notebook.
`make_collage.py` was used to make the collage image the_meg.jpg.
`make_video.py` was used to make the videos.
